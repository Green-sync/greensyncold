## Introduction

GreenSync is an application that helps farmers manage their farms. This roadmap provides an overview of the planned development of GreenSync.

## Current State

GreenSync is currently in the development phase of providing farmers with functionalities to track their crops and livestock, record weather conditions, manage farm inventory, and manage user accounts. The frontend application is being built using React, while the backend application is being developed with Node.js. The applications will communicate with each other using GraphQL APIs. We will also be utilizing additional packages for data visualization, authentication, and database management.
here is a breakdown of tasks at hand:

- React Website
- GraphQL API

## Future Plans

GreenSync plans to add the following features:

- **Field Mapping**: Farmers will be able to map their fields and track crop rotation and soil nutrients. This will help them make informed decisions about planting and harvesting crops.
- **Pest and Disease Detection**: GreenSync will leverage machine learning to detect and predict pests and diseases in crops and livestock. This will help farmers take timely action to prevent losses.
- **Marketplace**: GreenSync will provide farmers with a marketplace to buy and sell their products. This will enable farmers to expand their customer base and increase their profits.
- **Mobile App**: GreenSync will develop a mobile application to enable farmers to manage their farms on-the-go. The mobile app will allow farmers to record data even when they are not at their farm.

## Development Process

GreenSync will follow an agile development process with sprints of two weeks. Each sprint will focus on delivering a specific set of features or improvements. GreenSync will prioritize features based on customer feedback and market research. GreenSync will also conduct regular testing and bug fixes to ensure the stability and reliability of the application.

## Conclusion

GreenSync is an application that helps farmers manage their farms. With the addition of field mapping, pest and disease detection, marketplace, and mobile app, GreenSync will continue to provide value to farmers. The development process will follow an agile approach, with regular testing and bug fixes to ensure the stability and reliability of the application.
